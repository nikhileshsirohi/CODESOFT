# CODESOFT-CPP-Task-1
# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple C++ program that allows the user to play a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and prompts the user to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    g++ -o number_guessing_game number_guessing_game.cpp
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./number_guessing_game
    ```

4. The program will display a prompt asking you to guess a number between 1 and 100.

5. Enter your guess and press Enter.

6. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.

7. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the random number.

8. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.

9. The game will exit after you guess the correct number.

## About the Code

The C++ code provided in this repository uses the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header for simplicity, which includes various standard C++ headers. The program uses the `rand()` function to generate a random number, and it also demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your preferences!
